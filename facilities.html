                    <p>Nehru Museum of Science & Technology is located at the Hijli Detention camp building, now named as Hijli Saheed Bhavan. According to history, this building was constructed almost a century ago to house the district headquarters of proposed Hijli district but never used for that purpose. In early 1930-s, this building was converted to a detention camp for the Indian political prisoners. Thereafter in 1942 the US air force, as a part of the allied forces, took over the building for use as their headquarter and radio control unit for their air squadron. Soon after, the ideas for the establishment of a Higher Technical Institute germinated with the creation of the first of the Indian Institutes of Technology in 1951 at the same premises.</p>
                    <p>Considering the historical importance of the "Old Hijli Detention Camp", Prof K. L. Chopra, Director of I.I.T. Kharagpur from 1987 to 1997, took the initiative to house in it a museum to preserve the history of the building and for the popularisation of science and technology. A task force to look after the museum establishment was constituted under the chairmanship of Prof. G.L. Sinha in 1989. Members of this committee included dedicated teachers of the institute like Prof. S. T. H. Abidi and Prof. (Smt.) Mandakini Majumdar, who took major initiatives in establishing.</p>
