                    <h1>Illumination</h1>
                    <p>Illumination also popular as Illu is a tradition followed by every hall of residence during the Diwali festival every year. Large grid structures (called chatai) made of bamboo stripes are put and placeholder wires to mount diyas are placed to create the framework based on a theme decided by the student hall. On the day of Diwali, a couple of minutes before the arrival of chief guest and other officials, mounted diyas are lit up to showcase the intricate pictorial description. Also, based on the the theme of Illu, rest of the student hall is decorated as well. Preparations for Illu starts several weeks before the actual date of Diwali and involve active collaboration from the students.</p><p>Back in 1981, some innovative students from Azad hall of residence decided to celebrate diwali by lighting scores of diyas on giant chatais. In characteristic fashion, Nehru hall decided to make a GC event out of it- calling it the Bigyan sinha memorial cup. Up to the year 2013, top 3 halls were chosen for the best showcases by the Gymkhana and were awarded a pot of Rasgulla.</p>
