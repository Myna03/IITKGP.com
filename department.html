            <h1>Petroleum Engineering</h1>
            <br />
            <p>This academic program is aimed at the industrial needs of specialized competency and comparative lack of opportunities for such courses in Indian technical institutions. The program will also facilitate the need for competent manpower for the global petroleum exploration and production industry. Through this program IIT Kharagpur will develop a state of the art research and development facilities for various aspects of Petroleum Engineering leveraging the availability of interdisciplinary expertise available at IIT Kharagpur from its various academic units. The program will also minimize the existing gap of higher education and academic research in the field of oil and gas engineering in India through appropriate faculty training and induction of young engineers into quality research.</p>
            <p>The program would also give exposure to global industrial practices and work environments in the form of internships of adequate duration. Towards this attempt would be made to involve national and international industry such as: Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, ONGC, Total etc. Additionally there will be exposure to R&D programs of international institutions in the area such as : Texas A&M, University of Texas, Austin, University of Oklahoma etc. This would be achieved through collaborative research programs among faculty as well through M. Tech Projects etc.</p><br />

            <h1>School of Quality and Reliability</h1><br />
            <p>School on Quality and Reliability (Q&R), named after Renowned Quality Expert and distinguished alumnus of IIT Kharagpur, Dr. Subir Chowdhury is first of its kind in Asia. Reliability Engineering Center which is one of the pioneer in the field of Reliability in India from past 33 years is now venturing in the field of Quality with an aim to improve the trinity of Process, Planet and People (3P’s) targeting Engineering systems, natural systems and human systems. The School is truly an inter-disciplinary centre wherein faculty members as well as students from various disciplines comes together. Apart from traditional curriculum, the school also has a holistic view on Q&R by including various application domains of the 3P’s.</p>
